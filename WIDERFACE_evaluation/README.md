### Independent Evaluation Procedure for WIDERFACE
In this subpackage, we implement the evaluation procedure for WIDERFACE independently. 

* [SIO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10633) schema (Single Inference on the Original, we stick to use SIO since it is designed for
real-world applications) is adopted

* for each val image, a text file containing predicted bboxes in required format is generated

* use [official Matlab program](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) to produce evaluation results:
